## About

Configuration help can be found under `config_help.md` in the same folder as this.

Depends on [`modlib`](https://github.com/appgurueu/modlib).

**Please note that this mod may not work along well with other mods altering the HUD.**

Code licensed under the MIT License. Media license depends on hudbars(media files from there). Written by Lars Mueller alias LMD or appguru(eu).

## API

Code should be self-explanatory. If not, feel free to contact me (opening an issue is also fine). Will probably document it here at some point...
